The lack of access to adequate medical resources and facilities have led to the significant number of deaths. Some of these deaths could have been avoided by timely access to a medical professional or close proximity of hospitals.

Health systems across Africa are underfunded and understaffed. Less than half of African citizens (52%) – about 615 million people – have access to the health care they need, the quality of health services across the continent is generally poor, and family planning needs of half the continent’s women and girls are unmet

### Let’s focus on Africa in this dataset
You are required to provide solutions to the health challenges, especially in Africa. Ensure that you allow 
all your creative self to shine through and remember, Africa looks up to you for a solution.

LIMITATION:
* The type of drugs that cause death is not available. We could have narrow it down to who's producing such drugs and in what location is it killing the most.
* Types of poison causing death is not available. We could narrow it down to know if it's from companies or individuals.
* Data about each country GDP was not used. This could help narrow down why some countries refused to invest more in health expenditure.
