LIMITATION:
* The type of drugs that cause death is not available. We could have narrow it down to who's producing such drugs and in what location is it killing the most.
* Types of poison causing death is not available. We could narrow it down to know if it's from companies or individuals.
* Data about each country GDP was not used. This could help narrow down why some countries refused to invest more in health expenditure.
